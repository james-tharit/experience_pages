As a fullstack engineer, I've had the opportunity to contribute to two significant projects for a global online recruitment platform.
My first project involved building a learning and community platform to foster interaction and knowledge sharing among job seekers. I played a pivotal role in designing the system architecture to align with the client's business objectives. To optimize performance, I also implemented a GraphQL chain request feature, significantly improving data fetching efficiency.
Later on, I focused on consolidating multiple applications into a unified platform. I developed a seamless user migration process, ensuring a smooth transition for all users through a user-friendly offboarding flow. Additionally, I implemented a foolproof hard update system to guarantee successful data transfer.
